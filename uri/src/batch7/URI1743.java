An in-line connector is composed of five connection points, labelled from 1 to 5.
Each connection point of a connector can be either a plug (ðŸ”Œ) or an outlet (ðŸ•³).

Check the compatibility of two connectors!
two connectors are compatible if, for every label,
one connection point is a plug and the other connection point is an outlet

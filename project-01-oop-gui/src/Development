Time is being weird sometimes




GUI Version:
**From the video**
int/PButton flagCounter; //disabled - no listener needed
int/PButton timeCounter; //disabled - no listener needed
PButton smileyFace; //it resets the game if gets clicked; changes its face if loose/win {What to do when it gets clicked?}

PButton beginnerButton; //it resets the difficulty, therefore the grid
PButton intermediateButton; //it resets the difficulty, therefore the grid
PButton expertButton; //it resets the difficulty, therefore the grid

//Grid

**From my logic**
int difficulty = 1; //by default
GameLevel gameLevel;
Player player;
Field field;












Decision:
levelButtonSize = width/8f;
cellButtonSize = 32;


[ What I should implement next ]
- Let the user choose a difficulty (beginner is by default)
    * Resize and position all the elements accordingly
    * Have images, icons of appropriate sizes
Idea:
Just divide the screen into two parts; give the smallest ones to difficulty buttons while the large part will go to the grid itself.
=> you will just have to reposition of starting X, Y, but no resizing elements.

- Elements to add
* Mine counter (which counts flags)
* Smiley Face
* Time counter
* A feature to add/set flags on the right click

Problems that seem like I solved:
1) Buttons with numbers were hovered. Before disabling it, I have to make sure to put it into Normal mode (since according to the state,
everything will be drawn).
2) The button I clicked which contained a mine value, was with a background for an active mode. Before disabling it, I have to make sure to put it into Normal mode
(since according to the state, the corresponding background will be set).
